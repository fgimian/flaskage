Introduction
------------

The Flaskage template attempts to bring together all the best packages
and integrate them with Flask so you have a full stack MVC (or MTV)
structure ready-to-use.

Flaskage takes a lot of inspiration from frameworks like Ruby on Rails,
Play and Laravel and doesnâ€™t attempt to re-create the Django way of
working.

Quick Start
-----------

Install Flaskage in your virtualenv as follows:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+git://github.com/fgimian/flaskage.git

Create a new project:

.. code:: bash

    flaskage new <project-name>

Start the development server and check out your new project:

.. code:: bash

    cd <project-name>
    ./manage.py server

Refer to the `documentation <http://flaskage.readthedocs.org/>`_ for
further instruction.

Documentation
-------------

Please check out the `Flaskage documentation at Read the
Docs <http://flaskage.readthedocs.org/>`_.
