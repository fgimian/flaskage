## Introduction

The Flaskage template attempts to bring together all the best packages and
integrate them with Flask so you have a full stack MVC (or MTV) structure
ready-to-use.

Flaskage takes a lot of inspiration from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Play
and Laravel and doesnâ€™t attempt to re-create the Django way of working.

## Quick Start

Install Flaskage in your virtualenv as follows:

``` bash
pip install git+git://github.com/fgimian/flaskage.git
```

Create a new project:

``` bash
flaskage new <project-name>
```

Start the development server and check out your new project:

``` bash
cd <project-name>
./manage.py server
```

Refer to the [documentation](http://flaskage.readthedocs.org/) for further instruction.

## Documentation

Please check out the [Flaskage documentation at Read the Docs](http://flaskage.readthedocs.org/).
