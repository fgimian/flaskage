## TODO ##

Flaskage is currently a work in progress.  My current outstanding tasks are...

CLI:

* Provide the ability to turn off colors when using the flaskage command
* Complete unit tests for the flaskage CLI tool
* Consider a scaffolding command for BDD and Jade templates

Project Structure:

* Consider requirements files for each environment
* Improve organisation of assets and resolve multiple registrations during
  testing
* Determine the best way to deal with symbolic link for Twitter Bootstrap fonts
* Consider a better way to store sensitive configuration (e.g. secret keys
  and database credentials)

Documentation:

* Complete writing documentation

Long-term goals are as follows:

* Generation of scaffolding including CRUD
* Pluggable scaffolding modules
* Ability to generate foreign keys and relationships via scaffolding
