Configuring Your Project
========================

Flaskage makes it easy to maintain a hierarchical configuration that can work
in each of your environments.  The base class named **Config** is common
across all environments.  Classes which inherit from this object can then
define certain customisations which relate to each specific site.

Generating Secret Keys
----------------------

Open **config.py** and start by generating some good secret keys for each of
your environments.  To do this, simply open a Python shell and run the
following several times to generate multiple secret keys.

   >>> import os
   >>> os.urandom(24)

Place the contents of each randomly generated key in the **SECRET_KEY**
config parameter for each environment.

Database Configuration
----------------------

Next up, configure your database via the **SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI** variable.
Please find several examples below:

For **PostgreSQL**:

.. code-block:: python

    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://user:pass@host/dbname'

You'll need to install the psycopg2_ package to enable this database.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install psycopg2

.. note::

    In general, PostgreSQL provides superior performance and features to MySQL
    and is therefore the preferred database for use with Flaskage.

For **MySQL**:

.. code-block:: python

    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql://user:pass@host/dbname'

You'll need to install the MySQL-python_ package to enable this database.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install MySQL-python

For **SQLite**:

.. code-block:: python

    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = (
        'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(Config.PROJECT_ROOT, 'dbname.db')
    )

Please ensure that you add any newly installed package to the
**requirements/production.txt** file.  You may list your installed packages as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip freeze

.. important::

    It is highly recommended you setup multiple databases on your chosen
    database engine and use it to power all environments.  For example, if you
    choose to use PostgreSQL, then also install it on your dev server and
    setup databases for both dev and test.  This ensures that your 
    will seamlessly work in production as each database has its own quirks.

Managing Configuration Environments
-----------------------------------

As you'll notice, by default Flaskage provides a production, development and
testing configuration out of the box.

If you would like to add an additional configuration environment, simply
create a new class which inherits from **Config** similar to that below:

.. code-block:: python

    class StagingConfig(Config):
        SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://flaskage:pass123@localhost/stagingdb'

You'll then need to add the config to the **AVAILABLE_CONFIGS** global dict
so that it may be used.

.. code-block:: python

    AVAILABLE_CONFIGS = {
        'production': 'config.ProductionConfig',
        'development': 'config.DevelopmentConfig',
        'testing': 'config.TestingConfig',
        'staging': 'config.StagingConfig'
    }

While running the development server, a default configuration is loaded if
not specified by the user.  You may change the default config by updating the
**DEFAULT_CONFIG** global variable as shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    DEFAULT_CONFIG = 'staging'

.. _MySQL-python: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python
