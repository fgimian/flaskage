   :alt: Flaskage: a complete and carefully designed template for use with the Flask web framework
   :class: floatingflask

Welcome to Flaskage's documentation.  The Flaskage template attempts to bring
together all the best packages and integrate them with Flask so you have a 
full stack MVC (or MTV) structure ready-to-use.

Flaskage takes a lot of inspiration from frameworks like `Ruby on Rails`_,
Play_ and Laravel_ and doesn't attempt to re-create the Django way of working.

In addition to providing a template, this project also intends to document
common workflows with the template and serve as a good general point of
reference.

Some of the existing templates and projects which inspired and influenced this
project are:

- overholt_
- flasky_
- flask_website_
- beancounter_
- flaskr-bdd_
- fbone_
- cookiecutter-flask_
- flask-chassis_
