Installation
============

Flaskage is tested against the most common Linux distributions and Python
versions to ensure seamless usage.  Please follow the steps below to prepare
your operating system and Python environment.

Preparing Your Operating System
-------------------------------

Flaskage supports the following Linux operating systems:

- Debian 6 (Squeeze)
- Debian 7 (Wheezy)
- Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx)
- Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin)
- CentOS 5.x
- CentOS 6.x
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.x
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x

You'll need to install some pre-requisites to ensure that all Python packages
install correctly.

If you're running Python 3.3 on Ubuntu Server 12.04:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install gcc python3.3-dev git

If you're running Python 2.6 or 2.7 Debian or Ubuntu Server:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev git

If you're running CentOS 6.x or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo yum install gcc python-devel git

If you're running CentOS 5.x or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.x, you'll need to
use the python26 package from EPEL. You may then install required dependencies
as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
    $ sudo yum install gcc python26 python26-devel

Preparing Your Python Environment
---------------------------------

Flaskage supports the following Python versions:

- CPython 2.6
- CPython 2.7
- CPython 3.3
- PyPy 2.2

If you haven't already, you'll need to first install setuptools, pip and
virtualenv as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python
    $ easy_install pip
    $ pip install virtualenv

Create a virtualenv and install the Flaskage packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir ~/.virtualenv
    $ virtualenv ~/.virtualenv/flaskage
    $ source ~/.virtualenv/flaskage/bin/activate
    $ pip install git+git://github.com/fgimian/flaskage.git

You may now create a new project as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ flaskage new <project-name>
    $ cd <project-name>

Installing Node.js Components
-----------------------------

In order to use Bower, LESS, Clean CSS, Coffeescript and UglifyJS, we need to
install the necessary modules on our system via Node.js.

Firstly, ensure that your system has the latest Node.js installed and then run
the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ [sudo] npm install -g bower less clean-css coffee-script uglify-js

.. note::

    If your Node.js installation is global and owned by root, you'll need to 
    run the command above using sudo.

Installing jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap with Bower
--------------------------------------------------

From the project root directory, install the client-side libraries as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bower install

Running the Development Server
------------------------------

Once you have completed installing all the necessary components, you may start
the Flask development server using the following command in the root directory
of the project:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py server

This will run the development server on loopback address which will mean that
it will only be available for viewing by your development server.

If you wish to make the website available to other machines on the same
network, then start the development server as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py server -t 0.0.0.0
